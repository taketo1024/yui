The input data were kindly provided by Dr. Dirk Schuetz. 
These are knots such that s_Q != s_F2 or s_Q != s_F3, computed by `KnotJob'.

The output data are ss-invariants: see https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02494

The results can be reproduced by running:
$ cargo run -r --features bigint,poly,qint -- ss-batch computation/targets/14-15.json
