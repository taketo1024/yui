The input data were kindly provided by Dr. Dirk Schuetz. 
These are knots such that s_Q != s_F2 or s_Q != s_F3, computed by `KnotJob'.
https://www.maths.dur.ac.uk/users/dirk.schuetz/knotjob.html

The output data are ss-invariants: see https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02494
`ss_c^n:r|m` denotes the n-th order ss_c invariant (r: reduced, m: mirror).

The results can be reproduced by running:
$ cargo run -r --features bigint,poly,qint -- ss-batch computation/data/14-15.json
